Coming from a web background, the RGB color system of SWIFT and XCODE can be a little confusing, so we made 7 simple functions to help you out. There are also a number of built in color schemes that we have set up for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nmakeColor(hex) - enter in any old hex value\r\n\r\nmakeVerticalGradient(topColor, bottomColor) - takes 2 parameters, the first being the top color, and the second being the bottom color\r\n\r\nmakeHorizontalGradient(leftColor, rightColor) - takes 2 parameters, the first being the left color, and the second being the bottom color\r\n\r\nmakeGradient(color1, color2, startPoint, endPoint) - takes 4 parameters, first 2 being colors and the second 2 being the anchor points for your gradients. <b>startPoint</b> is where color1 will start, <b>endPoint</b> is where color 2 will start from.  The anchor points are defined as points which were based on grid system. \r\n\r\n     i.e. CGPointMake(0, 0) - top left corner,   CGPointMake(1, 1) - bottom right corner\r\n\r\nmakeOpac(color, alpha) - will take your color, and add alpha channel to it\r\n\r\nmakeLighter(color, percent) - will take your color and make it lighter by indicated percent\r\n\r\nmakeDarker(color, percent) - will take your color and make it darker by indicated percent\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n- can only make some colors so dark, and the percent is passed in as a whole number.  \r\ni.e.  makeLighter(FFFFFF, 20)\r\n\r\n\r\nColors\r\n\r\nred\t- FF3B30 \r\norange - FF9500\r\nyellow - FFCC00\r\ngreen -\t4cd964\r\naqua - 34aadc\r\nblue - 071ff\r\npurple - 5856d6\r\nlightgray -\tF7f7f7\r\nblack -\t1f1f21\r\ngray - Bdbec2\r\n\r\nredGradient - FF5E3A\tFF2A68\r\norangeGradient - Ff9500\tFf5e3a\r\nyellowGradient - Ffdb4c\tFfcd02\r\ngreenGradient - 87fc70\t0bd318\r\nlightBlueGradient - 52edc7\t5ac8fb\r\ndarkBlueGradient - 1ad6fd\t1d62f0\r\npinkGradient - Ef4db6\tC643fc\r\npurpleGradient - C644FC\t5856D6\r\ndarkGrayGradient - 4a4a4a\t2b2b2b\r\ngrayGradient - Dbddde\t898c90\r\nlightGrayGradient - F7f7f7\tD7d7d7\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
